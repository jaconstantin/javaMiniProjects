This folder contains my initial study on Java through the MIT opencourseware materials. I have skipped the initial assignments as they are very simple and similar to C++. The bulk of the lab work involves classes and predefined libraries from the Java API. I also have included some practice codes exploring Java concepts from the lectures. I included full comments that can be used as a quick reference in the future.

This folder contains my mini project on automating data acquisition of available apartment for Rent here in Melbourne Australia. I used Selenium WebDriver to do this exercise.

The main goal is to save the trouble of manually clicking through vast listings of webpages in domain.com.au. Instead, the program should run and navigate the web pages automatically and just return a text file containing important information such as Rent, bond, address, availability, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, parking, heating, airconditioning, laundry, and ofcourse the URL. It should then easier to compare and narrow done the best deals. The user just needs to visit those URL for checking the pictures.

I have used various functions from the WebDriver Library to automate user activity such as going to a url, mouse clicks, and text inputs,  and also to capture text information from various web elements. Basic knowledge of HTML and XPATHs greatly aided the element location process in this project. I have also tackled basic problems such as not being able to click/access none visible elements.

I have implemented convenience functions for repetitive tasks such as setting the rent limits, getting text info from a web element, and getting a set of information for an apartment in a single web page. 

The program works well. Unfortunately, depending on the internet connection and the current web traffic on the site itself, there are times the web page takes too long to load and the program will just time out.
